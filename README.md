# PIMPS-Final-Project

## Objective 

## Context 

For all producers of shows, it is difficult to get an accurate and detailed sales report. 
PIMS offers a solution to centralise the sales in a single online tool and cross-reference it with communication plans so that the producers can better anticipate the filling of the shows and improve the margins. 

## Mission

My mission was to find a solution to map PIMSâ€™s data with external sources so they could get more insights about their business.

## Result

My work permitted:
- to present a relevant solution to PIMS in order to categorize all their shows present in their catalogue 
- to enrich PIMS reflection about how they should challenge the way they collect their data
